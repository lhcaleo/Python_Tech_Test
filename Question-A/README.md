# Question A
**Description:** 

- Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

**Solutions:**

- In **check_overlap.py**, `check(x1,x2,x3,x4)`  function takes 4 parameters that are assumed to be `int` and representation of a point.

- Unit test is written in **test_check_overlap.py**
